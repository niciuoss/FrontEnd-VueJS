# Introduction

Imagine browsing pages (routes), receiving alerts and notifications, having a countdown timer on the page, a progress bar, a loading or a change of route in a SPA. Now imagine all this happening to people who have visual disabilities and who use screen readers.  

The [@vue-a11y/announcer](https://github.com/vue-a11y/vue-announcer) provides an easy way to really tell whatâ€™s going on in your application to people using screen readers.
